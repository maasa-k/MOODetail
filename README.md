# MOODetail

MOODetail is a Single Page Application using JavaScript on the frontend and a Rails API backend. Use this app to detail prompts you notice to specific mood states. 

## Installation

For the Rails API, run the following code: 

```cd moodetail-api
bundle install
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
rails s
```
For the JavaScript front end, open the following file in a browser: `moodetail-js-frontend/index.html`

## Usage

After seeding the database for the mood states, you can now enter descriptions of prompts to various moods.  Once entered, the descriptions will append to the appropriate "mood card" and will save to the database.
